**NAME**: SWADHA ARYA

**DOMAIN**:DATA ANALYTICS

**BATCH DURATION**:JANUARY 25, 2025 TO MARCH 25 , 2025

**MENTOR NAME**: NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

**DESCRIPTION**:
The sentiment analysis model was built to classify **airline-related tweets** into three categories: **negative, neutral, and positive**. The dataset consists of tweets from airline passengers, capturing their feedback, complaints, and experiences. Given the nature of airline services, the dataset is skewed towards **negative sentiments**, reflecting common issues like flight delays, customer service problems, and baggage mishandling.  

To process this textual data, **Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques** were applied, including **text cleaning (removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters)** and **TF-IDF vectorization** to convert the text into numerical form. A **Logistic Regression** model was trained on this transformed data to predict sentiment. The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using **accuracy and a classification report**, showing its effectiveness in distinguishing sentiment categories.  

To better understand the dataset, **visualizations** such as **sentiment distribution plots and word clouds** were created, highlighting the most frequently used words in positive, neutral, and negative tweets. Finally, an **interactive component** allows users to input tweets and receive real-time sentiment predictions, making the model engaging and practical for sentiment analysis in airline customer feedback.

**OUTPUT**:
